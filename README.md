# Credit Default

This is a machine learning problem that involves classification, with the goal of identifying the factors that contribute to users defaulting on their loan and credit card payments. 

Multiple algorithms were tested in order to determine which one performs best for this task. The ultimate objective was to establish the optimal threshold for classifying each user based on their likelihood of defaulting, and to maximize earnings according to the relevant business rules.
